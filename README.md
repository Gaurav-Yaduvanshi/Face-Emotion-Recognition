# Face-Emotion-Recognition

# Project Description
Build a deep learning model which detects the real time emotions of students through a webcam and gives the real time aggregated feedback to the instructor about the class so that instructor can understand if the students are able to grasp the topic according to students expression or emotions using CNN model.
The data consists of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces. The faces have been automatically registered so that the face is more or less centred and occupies about the same amount of space in each image.
The task is to categorize each face based on the emotion shown in the facial expression into one of seven categories (0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral). The training set consists of 28,709 examples and the public test set consists of 7,178 examples.
